This is a Vim version of daemon_saver from FreeBSD.
The script adds :Daemon command, which starts screensaver.
Daemon speed is adjustable through g:daemon_saver_speed variable. Default is '80' (ms).

To start the screensaver automatically after some time put this to your .vimrc:

au CursorHold * Daemon
set updatetime=60000

This will start Daemon after 60 seconds of vim being idle.
